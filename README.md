# Introduction

This project analyzes the growth and distribution of electric vehicles (EVs) across the United States using vehicle registration data for each state.
The insights from this analysis will compare EV, PHEV, HEV, and gasoline market shares, identify where EV adoption is strongest or weakest, and uncover meaningful trends in alternative fuel usage.
Furthermore, this project highlights leading and lagging states in EV adoption and provides data-driven recommendations on where policymakers should prioritize investment.

# Electric Vehicles Distribution Highlights
<img width="1838" height="768" alt="Dashboard 1 (1)" src="https://github.com/user-attachments/assets/19ecec3f-9057-4303-bf82-7c46acf44c32" />

1. States with the Highest EV Distribution:
California has far more EVs than any other state, more than 1 million. Florida and Texas follow but at much lower levels, each under 300,000 EVs. These states have large populations and major metro areas driving EV adoption. Overall trend: EV adoption is strongly correlated with population size, urbanization, and progressive environmental policy. States with established EV incentives and infrastructure show significantly higher EV presence.

2. States with the Lowest EV Distribution: 
North Dakota and Wyoming have the fewest EVs, both below 1,500. These states are geographically large, rural, and have limited charging infrastructure to EV adoption. South Dakota, Alaska, West Virginia, and Mississippi fall in the mid-low range. Overall trend: Low-population rural states with long average driving distances, and fewer charging stations exhibit markedly lower EV adoption. Many of these states also have fewer state-level incentives supporting EVs.

# Market Analysis
### 1. Percentage of EVs, PHEVs, HEVs, and Gasoline Vehicles by State
- Gasoline vehicles remain the dominant mode of transportation nationwide, with most states recording over 80% gasoline registrations. For example, Rhode Island has the highest share at 89.11%, while Wyoming has the lowest at 74.91%.
- California stands out as the clear leader in Electric vehicles adoption at 3.41%, followed by states like DC (2.60%), and Hawaii (2.37%).
- Plug-In Hybrid Electric vehicles adoption is highest in DC (1.19%), California (1.11%), and Vermont (0.96%).
- HEVs show a stronger presence than both EVs and PHEVs in many regions, including DC (5.80%), California (4.62%), and Washington (4.51%) highlighting the significant role hybrids play in alternative-fuel markets.
  
### 2. Top 5 States with Highest EV Adoption Rate

- California and The District of Columbia and lead the nation in EV adoption, each with roughly 3% of registered vehicles being electric, making them clear frontrunners.
- Following them are states such as Hawaii, Washington, and Nevada showing similarly strong adoption levels, all near the 2% range.
- In most states, however, EV penetration remains low, around 1% or below, with 34 states falling under the 1% threshold.

### 3. Compare EV adoption in California vs. other large states (e.g., Texas, Florida, New York)

- Among major states, California stands out with a 3.41% EV adoption rate, placing it well ahead.
- Florida, despite having over 254,000 registered EVs, reaches only 1.37%, highlighting a much lower penetration relative to its total vehicle base.
- New York reports a similar pattern, with EVs making up just 1.16% of vehicles.
- Texas shows the weakest adoption at 0.89%. Even though the state has more than 230,000 EVs, its large vehicle population dilutes the overall adoption rate.
