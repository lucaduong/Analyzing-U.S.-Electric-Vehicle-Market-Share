# INTRODUCTION
---
This project analyzes the growth and distribution of electric vehicles (EVs) across the United States using vehicle registration data for each state.
The insights from this analysis will compare EV, PHEV, HEV, and gasoline market shares, identify where EV adoption is strongest or weakest, and uncover meaningful trends in alternative fuel usage.
Furthermore, this project highlights leading and lagging states in EV adoption and provides data-driven recommendations on where policymakers should prioritize investment.
